            <h1 class="titulo-destaque">About me:</h1>
            <p class="apresentacao__conteudo__texto">I've always been very passionate about technology, when I was younger I liked to open the source code of websites and change them in Google Chrome, I'm not very proud but I've played a little with DDOS and that kind of thing (I only took down my network). I've always been on top of new technologies and my eye shines when I'm thinking about a more technological future.</p>
            <p class="apresentacao__conteudo__texto">I learned programming through <a class="alura" href="https://www.alura.com.br/sobre#:~:text=A%20Alura%20comp%C3%B5e%20o%20maior,j%C3%A1%20n%C3%A3o%20est%C3%A3o%20bem%20definidas.">Alura</a>, researching, watching videos and mainly opening the programs and playing with it. I understand that I still have a long way to go, that's why I decided to enter the Faculty of Computer Science in 2023!</p>

            <h2 class="titulo-destaque">Goals:</h2>
            <p class="apresentacao__conteudo__texto"><strong> I'm looking for opportunities in the programming area, either as an internship or as a young apprentice, considering my basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Python. My goal is to learn more about these technologies as well as get a taste of the job market in my future profession.</strong></p>
