            <h1 class="titulo-destaque">About me:</h1>
            <p class="apresentacao__conteudo__texto">From an early age, I developed a deep interest in technology. I remember when I was younger and opened the source code of websites, making some changes in Chrome DevTools. In my curiosity, I briefly experimented with concepts such as DDOS (in this case, only on my own network). Over time, I kept up to date with the latest technologies, and this pursuit of knowledge became an intrinsic part of my daily life. The simple idea of an increasingly technological future continues to awaken more and more my passion and enthusiasm for this area.</p>
            <p class="apresentacao__conteudo__texto">I learned to program through <a class="alura" href="https://www.alura.com.br/sobre#:~:text=A%20Alura%20comp%C3%B5e%20o%20maior,j%C3%A1%20n%C3%A3o%20est%C3%A3o%20bem%20definidas.">Alura</a>, researching, watching videos and opening my programs and by playing with them. I understand that I still have a long way to go, that's why I decided to enter the <b>Faculty of Computer Science in 2023!</b></p>
            <img class="imagem" src="./assets/95.png" alt="minha foto programando">
            <h2 class="titulo-destaque">Goals:</h2>
            <p class="apresentacao__conteudo__texto">I'm looking for opportunities in the programming area, either as an internship or as a young apprentice, considering my knowledge of <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Java and SQL(MySQL and PostgreSQL)</strong>. My goal is to learn more about these technologies as well as get a taste of the job market in my future profession.</p>
